# SDK for Python Clients CHANGELOG

## 1.0.1 build 20221205
_Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.3.0._<br>
_Compatible with code developed for the previous versions._<br>
_Released on 5 Dec 2022._

<!-- 2022/12/05 -->
Fixed a bug that could have caused a `Subscription` object not to be deleted after a call to `LightstreamerClient.unsubscribe`.


## 1.0.0 build 20221122
_Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.3.0._<br>
_Not compatible with code developed for the previous versions._<br>
_Released on 22 Nov 2022._

Improved the "delta delivery" mechanism, by adding the support for value differences, as per the extension introduced in Server version 7.3.0.

Added the `getValueAsJSONPatchIfAvailable` function in the `ItemUpdate` class, to take advantage of the new support for JSON Patch differences, which may prove useful in some use cases.

Changed the package name of the library from `lightstreamer_client` to `lightstreamer.client`.

Leveraged the standard module `logging` for the implementation of the class `ConsoleLoggerProvider`. Now all the log messages are forwarded to the logger (of type `logging.Logger`) with name `lightstreamer`.

Improved the compatibility: now the library is compatible with Python 3.7 or above.


## 1.0.0-beta.2 build 20220809

_Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.2._<br>
_Released on 9 August 2022_

Fixed the exception `TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str` that could have concealed a network error.


## 1.0.0-beta.1 build 20220624

_Compatible with Lightstreamer Server since 7.2._<br>
_Released on July 2022_

The new Python client library introduces full support for the Unified Client API model that we have been introducing in all client libraries for some years now. The big advantage in using the Unified API is that the same consistent interface and behavior are guaranteed across different client platforms. In other words, the same abstractions and internal mechanisms are provided for very different platforms (Web, Andorid, Java, iOS, ...), while respecting the conventions, styles, and best practice of each platform.
