# Lightstreamer Python Client SDK

> ⚠️ This library has been superseded by a new Lightstreamer Client SDK and is no longer actively maintained. Please find the updated library in [🔥this project🔥](https://github.com/Lightstreamer/Lightstreamer-lib-client-haxe)

Lightstreamer Python Client SDK enables any Python application to communicate bidirectionally with a [Lightstreamer Server](http://www.lightstreamer.com). The API allows to subscribe to real-time data pushed by the server and to send any message to the server.

## Installation

You can install the Lightstreamer Client SDK from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lightstreamer-client-lib/):

```
python -m pip install lightstreamer-client-lib
```
