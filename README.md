# Lightstreamer Python Client SDK

Lightstreamer Python Client SDK enables any Python application to communicate bidirectionally with a [Lightstreamer Server](http://www.lightstreamer.com). The API allows to subscribe to real-time data pushed by the server and to send any message to the server.

⚠️ This library is automatically generated from the Lightstreamer Haxe Client SDK, which is going to be made available soon in a separate Github project.

## Installation

You can install the Lightstreamer Client SDK from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lightstreamer-client-lib/):

```
python -m pip install lightstreamer-client-lib
```
